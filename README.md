# **Thermal Synthesizer**
This project contains three labs:

1. **Frequency Control**: Simulating a Low-Pass Filter with an RC circuit.
2. **Simple Resonance**: Exploring resonance via an LC tank.
3. **Thermal Synthesizer**: Investigating the effects of temperature on the damping of an RLC synthesizer.

This project was created as part of an extra credit project for **Berkeley's Physics 7B** class.

## **How to Run the Labs**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```

3. Activate your virtual environment:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Mac/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame soundfile scipy pillow
   ```

5. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
