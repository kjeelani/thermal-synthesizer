# Thermal Synthesizer
This project contains three labs:
1) Frequency Control (simulating a Low-Pass Filter with an RC circuit)
2) Simple Resonance (via an LC tank)
3) Thermal Syntheizer (exploring the effects of temperature on damping of an RLC synthesizer)

This was created as part of an extra credit project for Berkeley's Physics 7B class.

To run these lab:
1) Clone the repository
2) Create a virtual environment via `python -m venv env`
3) Open your virtual environment via `env/Scripts/activate` on Windows or `source env/bin/activate` on Mac
4) pip install pygame, soundfile, scipy, and pillow
5) Run the program via `python main.py`
